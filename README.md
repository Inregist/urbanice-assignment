Urbanice-assignment

This repo has 3 assignments
1. MailService
2. Contacts api (**Note: this api doesn't use any external database**)
3. Tax Calculator

You can import postman api collection from [here](https://github.com/Inregist/urbanice-assignment/blob/main/postman-collection/Urbanice.postman_collection.json)

For `MailService` I've some problem with `SendGrid`, So I use `Nodemailer` instead.  
And since Google disabled `LessSecure` you might want to see the solution [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72581650)
